<h1>A web hosting for a chatbot based on Sora from the Kingdom Hearts Series</h1>
<h3>The bot is trained on the scripts from the three mainline Kingdom Hearts games. 
  It will respond conversationally as the character. 
  I used the medium DIaloGPT model because it is a good balance between the quality of responses and load time since I am not hosting the model locally.
This does mean the model may not always load correctly currently due to the way it is hosted. More of a proof of concept.</h3>
